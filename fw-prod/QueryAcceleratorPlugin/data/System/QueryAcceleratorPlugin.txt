---++ Summary of Contents

This plugin uses the Foswiki:Extensions.DBCacheContrib to provide scalable
queries over large webs. It accelerates the standard Foswiki query language
by using a database which caches the contents of the topics.

The plugin is design primarily for use with very large bodies of data; in
excess of 1000 topics in a single web. Below that threshold, the performance
of the standard query implementation may be found to be equivalent or in
some cases, superior.

---+++ Features
   * Perform efficient structured queries in very large webs
   * Supports standard Foswiki queries
