%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

---++ Summary of Contents

!BuildContrib can be used to create a build script for your extension.
It is inspired by the Java ANT build tool developed by the Apache project,
but is targeted specifically at building Foswiki extensions. It is also
used for Foswiki release builds. The advantage of using !BuildContrib is that it
dictates a standard structure and build procedure, which makes your extension
easier for you, and others, to build and maintain.

Features:
   * not just for building code modules, can also be used
     to package !WikiApplications, and even pure documentation packages.
   * automatically generates an installer script that can help simplify
     end-user installation.
   * includes a wizard script for creating a new extension.
   * supports creating collections of extensions.

__Notes__
   * This is a _build and packaging_ module for use by _developers_, *not*
     an _install_ module for _end users_ (though it does _build_ an installer
     script, among other things).
   * The module has *only been tested on Linux*, but *should* work with
     Cygwin OK.

---++ Fast Start
If you don't like reading documentation, and just want a fast route to creating a new extension, then:
   1 Install the contrib using the instructions below
   1 =cd= to the root of your git =foswiki/distro= checkout
   1 =perl core/create_new_extension.pl= <i>extension_name</i>
   1 Init the new Extension directory as its own git repository.  (Don't add extensions into the distro repository!)
then modify the extension files as required (including MANIFEST). Then when you are ready to create archives:
   1 cd to the <i>[extensions_name]</i>/lib/Foswiki/<i>[Plugins|Contrib]</i>/<i>[extension_name]</i> directory.
   1 =perl ./build.pl <i>extension_name</i> release=
      * Archives (.zip, .tgz) will be created in =<i>extension_name</i>=

#DevelopmentModel
---++ Development Model
The build module assumes:
   1 two kinds of extension modules; 'Plugins', and 'Contribs' (everything else e.g Skins, !WikiApplications etc),
      * Archaic =AddOn= modules are supported but should not be used for new extensions.
   1 you have some passing familiarity with build tools such as =make=,
   1 you are *not* developing your extension in a 'production'
     installation (something that is usually a really bad idea), but are
     instead doing the sensible thing and developing in a separate directory
     tree
      * usually - but not always - a git checkout area.

---++ Standard directory structure
!BuildContrib is used to build the Foswiki core, as well as most extensions. This
document will focus on its use for building extensions. See the
=tools/build.pl= file in a git checkout of =foswiki/distro= for information on building
the core.

Extensions are developed in subdirectories of the =foswiki/distro= checkout.
For example, !BathPlugin will be developed in =BathPlugin=.
This directory is called the _root directory_ for the extension.

<div class="foswikiHelp">%T%Even though your extension root directory is
within =foswiki/distro=, it is almost _never_ checked into the =foswiki/distro=
repository.   =foswiki/distro= is reserved for default components that we ship
with foswik.
</div>

The standard directory structure under a root directory mirrors a standard
installation tree. Every plugin has some _key files_:
   * =lib/=
      * =Foswiki/=
         * =Plugins/= (or) =Contrib/=
            * <code><i>name</i>.pm</code> - code file for the plugin or contrib, usually derived
              from !EmptyPlugin or !EmptyContrib
            * <code><i>name</i>/</code> - directory containing sub-modules
              used by your plugin/contrib, and for storing your =build.pl= script
              and other support files. It is referred to as the _module
              directory_
               * =build.pl= - build script for this extension
               * =MANIFEST= - list of files to be installed
               * =DEPENDENCIES= - list of modules this extension depends on
               * =Config.spec= - =configure= setup for this extension
   * =data/=
      * =System/=
         * <code><i>name</i>.txt</code> - your plugin/contrib topic
   * =test/=
      * =unit/=
         * <code><i>name</i>/</code> - directory containing unit tests for the
           extension
   * =pub/=
      * =System/=
         * <code><i>name</i>/</code> - directory where all your images, css, and Javascript files should go
Contribs are held in the =lib/Foswiki/Contrib= directory instead of =lib/Foswiki/Plugins= but otherwise in exactly work the same way.

<div class="foswikiHelp">
%X% Foswiki configure now requires a perl module in either the =Plugins= or =Contrib= directory with the same name as the
extension. This module should have two global variables - =$VERSION= and =$RELEASE= which are used to determine the installed version of the extension.
Plugins also need =$SHORTDESCRIPTION= which shows up on InstalledPlugins and is merged with the =System/YourPlugin= topic when build is run,
</div>

Other directories normally found in a Foswiki installation may also exist under a root directory e.g. =tools=,  =bin=, =templates= etc.

While development in a git checkout is *strongly* recommended, it is also possible to develop in a normal Foswiki install. To do this, simply install the !BuildContrib.

---++ Setting up for Development

See Foswiki:Development.HowToStartExtensionDevelopmentInGit for further
details on how to build your development environment.

---+++ Environment Variables

Your build script has to know how to find the Foswiki libraries, so it can
pick up the components of the build system. Set =FOSWIKI_LIBS= (which is a
path, same as =PERL5LIB=) to point to your =lib= directory in your development
Foswiki. =$FOSWIKI_LIBS= is used to extend @INC _for the duration of the build
only_, so it won't mask problems during testing.

The approach we _recommend_ is to set =FOSWIKI_LIBS= in your login script (e.g. =.login=, =.csh=, =.profile= depending on what shell you prefer).

<div class="foswikiHelp">
%X% *EXPERTS*: =build.pl= does *not* read =bin/setlib.cfg=. It uses =$FOSWIKI_LIBS= only to find the modules for the !BuildContrib.
</div>

---++ Build script
Each individual extension has its own build script, called =build.pl=, in its
module directory. A build script is a perl script that takes a number of
 _targets_ as its parameters. For example, =perl build.pl test= will run unit
tests, and =perl build.pl release= will build a new release.

The build script also accepts the following options:
| =-n= | Do nothing; just print what you would have done |
| =-N= | Don't upload anything (used for testing target =upload=) |
| =-v= | Be verbose |
| =-topiconly= | with target =upload=, only upload the topic (not the archives) |

Build targets are Perl functions, which operate on various data defined
in control files to build the various targets. Perl is used rather than
=make= for portability reasons.

The targets you will normally use are:
| =build= | perform basic build steps |
| =compress= | Generate compressed versions of !JavaScript and CSS files |
| =tidy= | Run Perl::Tidy on all perl modules listed in the MANIFEST |
| =test= | run [[#UnitTesting][unit tests]] |
| =release= | =build=, =pod= and package a release zip |
| =upload= | =build=, =pod=, =release= and upload |
| =manifest= | print a guess at the MANIFEST (Caution - omits the primary System/Extension.txt topic |
| =gitignore= | print a guess at the .gitignore  |
| <del>=history=</del> | <del>Generates a list of svn checkins with comments suitable for use in the history section of the plugin/contrib topic.</del> Not functional on a git repository. |
| =dependencies= | Find and print a best-guess dependencies list (for DEPENDENCIES) |

The default target is =test=. The !BuildContrib is designed so that most common behaviour is catered for. It is also easy to _override_ any of the default targets in your =build.pl= and add extra behaviours.

---+++ The =build= target
Does nothing by default. This is the first target executed, and can be overridden by your build.pl to do something unusual - for example, executing an ANT file to build some Java.

---+++ The =compress= target
Usually only used if your extension includes Javascript or CSS, this target
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)][minifies]] a file
to generate another that is functionally identical, but smaller for faster
download. It will search for an avaliable minifier:

   * [[https://npmjs.org/package/uglify-js][UglifyJS]] *Recommended*
   * [[http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2012/10/16/state-of-yui-compressor/][yuicompressor]]
   * CPAN:JavaScript::Minifier and CPAN:CSS::Minifier

To make the recommended compressor avaliable on your system, first install
[[http://nodejs.org/][Node.js]],   and then use "npm" to install the
compressors:  =npm install -g uglifyjs=  and =npm install -g cssmin=
This will install both uglify and !MinCSS.

The compression can work with a number of different naming schemes, depending
on what files you refer to in your MANIFEST. For example, the name mappings
for javascript are:
   1 =XXX_src.js= -> =XXX.js=
   2 =XXX_src.js= -> =XXX.compressed.js=
   3 =XXX.uncompressed.js= -> =XXX.compressed.js=
   4 =XXX.uncompressed.js= -> =XXX.js=
   5 =XXX.js= -> =XXX.compressed.js=
i.e. if you list =XXX.compressed.js= in MANIFEST, then the build will look
for =XXX.uncompressed.js= or =XXX.js= in the source tree to generate it from.
=XXX.compressed.js= will be regenerated even if it exists in the source tree
itself. If you list =XXX.js= in MANIFEST, then the build will look for a
=XXX.uncompressed.js= or =XXX_src.js= in the sources to generate it from.
The new files are generated in the source tree, so can be used for pseudo
installation and testing. However they are *not* checked in.

The easiest way to use compressed sources is to select the version your code is
to use based on a switch when you include the headers. For example, you can
use the =DEBUG= global from the =Assert= module:

<verbatim class="perl">
use Assert; # Standard Foswiki ASSERT module
...
my $pack = DEBUG ? '.uncompressed' : '.compressed';
Foswiki::Func::addToHEAD(<<SCRIPT);
<script type="text/javascript" src="%PUBURLPATH% \%SYSTEMWEB% \MyPlugin/my$pack.js">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="%PUBURLPATH% \%SYSTEMWEB% \MyPlugin//my$pack.css" />
</script>
SCRIPT
</verbatim>

When =DEBUG= is defined (i.e. when ASSERT is enabled), this will include
=my.uncompressed.js= and =my.uncompressed.css=, which makes debugging easier.
If =DEBUG= is not defined, it will include =my.compressed.js= and
=my.compressed.css= instead for best performance.

If you have your own debugging flag in your extension, you could use that
instead of =DEBUG=.

---+++ The =tidy= target
This target runs Perl::Tidy (with default formatting options) over your
source code. This reformats the code consistently with the Foswiki
coding standards.

---+++ The =test= target
The test target is designed for use with extensions that have unit tests written using the !UnitTestContrib. It automatically runs the unit tests found in the =test/unit/<i>extension_name</i>= directory.

---+++ The =release= target
The results of the =release= target are:
   * a Zip format archive,
   * a gzipped tar archive,
   * a md5 checksum,
   * the extension topic,
   * an installer script

The archives will each contain the following:
   1 All the files listed in the =MANIFEST=
   1 Another copy of the install/uninstall scripts

---+++ The =tracked= target
The =tracked= target is a special case of the =release= target. Given the
name of a customer, it will calculate a ciphered ID and replace
=%<nop>$TRACKINGCODE%= in the sources and documentation with the calculated
code. It will then make a release for that specific customer that
includes the tracking code. This is useful where you want
to be able to trace the code back to that customer without revealing any
details about them.

To use this target, you must manually add %$TRACKINGCODE% into your
sources and documentation.

---+++ The =upload= target
This target builds a release, and then tries to upload it to a target repository. The target uploads all the files in the release, and also tries to upload any attachments to the extension topic (as found by scanning the topic for META:FILEATTACHMENT).

You can control what server the upload is done to. This lets you - for example - set up your own corporate extensions server.   Note that the =upload= operation will first attempt to download the topic to recover the !PackageForm so that it can be added to the newly uploaded topic.
The =upload= also gives you a chance to specify an alternate download location
to be used for !PackageForm recovery.

---+++ The =manifest= and =dependencies= targets
These are used when you are unsure of the correct contents of MANIFEST and DEPENDENCIES. They make a best-guess at the required contents for these files.

---++ The =twiki= target

TWiki<sup>&reg;</sup> is the precursor of Foswiki, and some support
for building extensions for TWiki is built in to the BuildContrib.

Firstly, extensions that were developed for use with the old TWiki
!BuildContrib can be built using the Foswiki !BuildContrib. Just modify
the =build.pl= to load the Foswiki build system rather than the old TWiki
build system.

Secondly, BuildContrib has a special target, =twiki=, which can be used
with a Foswiki build script to generate a TWiki directory structure and build
script, that can then be used to build an extension targeted at TWiki. The
files in the extension are run through a number of "mapping rules" that
will map much of the Foswiki namespace to TWiki. This transformation is not
complete, because Foswiki has many more features than TWiki, and because
CSS and Javascript cannot be reliably transformed this way. However many
extensions will work in TWiki after this transformation, and for others it
can be used as a launchpad for further manual mapping steps.

Example,

<verbatim class="bash">

</verbatim>

There is no TWiki-specific topic generated. The Foswiki topic should suffice.
Installer generation is also disabled using =!option installers none= in
the tranformed MANIFEST. Users must install the generated TWiki packages
manually from the command-line. This is required due to bugs in TWiki.

Note the =TWiki_= prefix on the archive names. This is useful to avoid naming
clashes with the standard Foswiki release of the same package. It is defined
using =!option archive_prefix TWiki_= in the tranformed MANIFEST.

Extension authors are strongly recommended to check the functioning of the
TWiki versions of their extensions very carefully.

TWiki<sup>&reg;</sup> is a trademark of Peter Thoeny.

---++ MANIFEST
The =MANIFEST= file contains a list of all the files that are wanted in the
package. Each line is a file path, relative to the root of the installation.
Wildcards may NOT be used.
If the path contains spaces it must be enclosed in double-quotes.

Each file path has an optional octal permissions mask and a description.
For example,

<verbatim>
data/System/BathPlugin.txt 0664 Plugin description topic
lib/Foswiki/Plugins/BathPlugin.pm 0444 Plugin code module
</verbatim>

If no permissions are given, permissions are guessed from the permissions on
the file in the source tree. These permissions are used by the installer
script to set file permissions in the installation.

The following permissions are recommended, and will be applied by default if
you don't specify anything different:
| *File type* | *Permissions* | *Meaning* |
| =.pm= file | 0444 | Anyone can read, but cannot write or execute |
| =.pl= file | 0554 | Anyone can read, user and group can also execute |
| =data/....txt= file | 0664 | Anyone can read, only owner can write |
| File in =pub/= | 0644 | ditto |
| File in =bin/= | 0555 | Anyone can read or execute, but not write |
| Anything other file | 0444 | Anyone can read, but cannot write or execute |
| directories | 0775 | default directories to traversable |

Do *not* include:
   * =,v= files. If you include a =,v= file it will overwrite any existing =,v= file when an extension is upgraded, potentially wiping out local changes on the end users installation.
   (The extension installer will not install =,v= files even if they are included in the MANIFEST.  However this is still a concern for anyone installing manually using =unzip= or =tar=.
   and sites using the new =PlainFileStore= will encounter errors if RCS =,v= files are present.)
   * =build.pl=, =MANIFEST=, or any other side file used by the build process.
   * unit tests
---+++ Directives
MANIFEST files can contain a number of directives that are used to control
aspects of the build process. These directives always start with an
exclamation mark (!) and must be on a line on their own.

---++++ =!ci= and =!noci=
By default, files in the data and pub directories are
automatically checked in to Foswiki when the installation script is run
(for example, when installing from =configure=). This is useful when you
expect users to customise your files locally and you don't want to risk
overwriting their customisations. If you want to suppress this checkin
behaviour for individual files, you can add the string =(noci)= anywhere
in the description of the file. If you want to suppress it for larger
numbers of files, you can use the =!noci= and =!ci= directives in the
MANIFEST. Any files listed after a =!noci= directive, up to the next =!ci=
directive or the end of the file, will not be checked in when installing
to Foswiki 1.0.1 or later

---++++ =!include=

---+++++ =!include= _&lt;path to extension directory&gt;_
MANIFESTs can also include other extensions that have been packaged using
!BuildContrib. For example,

<verbatim>
!include WysiwygPlugin/lib/Foswiki/Plugins/WysiwygPlugin
</verbatim>

This will include the !WysiwygPlugin in the release package.

Note that there is a script in the Foswiki =tools= directory called =check_manifest.pl= that can be run at any time to check the contents of your MANIFEST against what is checked into Subversion.

---+++++ =!include= _&lt;path to extension MANIFEST* file &gt;_
When the target is a file, and not a directory, !BuildContrib will recursively
process the MANIFEST file inline.  This is useful when an extension packages a
complex 3rd party tool, for example, the !TinyMCE Editor, and includes multiple
versions.  Each copy of the tool can be included with it's own MANIFEST:

Primary MANFIEST

<verbatim>
...
pub/System/TinyMCEPlugin/screenshot.png 0644
!include lib/Foswiki/Plugins/TinyMCEPlugin/MANIFEST-3.4.9
!include lib/Foswiki/Plugins/TinyMCEPlugin/MANIFEST-3.5.7
!include lib/Foswiki/Plugins/TinyMCEPlugin/MANIFEST-4.0.8
pub/System/TinyMCEPlugin/tinymce.gif 0644
...
</verbatim>

Manifest for !TinyMCE version 3.4.9

<verbatim>
!noci
pub/System/TinyMCEPlugin/tinymce-3.4.9/LICENSE.TXT 0644
#pub/System/TinyMCEPlugin/tinymce-3.4.9/build.bat 0644
#pub/System/TinyMCEPlugin/tinymce-3.4.9/build.xml 0644
...
</verbatim>

---++++ =!option=
=!option= is a general directive used to define global options. Currently
supported options are:
   * =!option archive_prefix String_= will prefix the name of generated
     archive files with =String_
   * =!option installer none= will suppress the generation of an installer
     script.

---++ DEPENDENCIES
The =DEPENDENCIES= file specifies dependencies on other extensions and
perl modules. Each line of the file is a single dependency:

<verbatim>
name, version, type, description
</verbatim>

where
   * name is the name of the module,
      * For Foswiki/TWiki/and CPAN modules, write the full module path, =Foswiki::Plugins::MyPlugin=
      * For external modules, use a "well known" name that can be understood by other package managers. Alternative packaging like =.deb= packages can resolve these external dependencies.
   * version is the version constraint (e.g. ">1.5"),
      * If version is written as =r1234=  (r followed by 1-6 digit number), the SVN release of the module will be compared, instead of the version.
      * _Legacy dependencies - if written as a simple 4-digit number, will be assumed to be a SVN release number._
   * type is its type (cpan, perl, or eternal)
      * =cpan= modules should be found in the CPAN repositories.
      * =perl= modules include =Foswiki::= and =TWiki::= modules.
      * =external= or any other value is reported but ignored.
   * description is a short description of the module and where to get it. If it begins with the word =Optional= then the dependency will not be automatically resolved.

<div class="foswikiHelp">
%X% Dependencies of type =cpan= or =perl= will be executed in an =eval= statement to compare the VERSION and RELEASE strings.  
</div>

The installer script written by the build process uses the dependency type to decide how to install dependant modules. 'cpan' means 'get the module from CPAN' and 'perl' means 'get the module from the Plugins web on Foswiki.org' (or whatever other repositories the admin has specified using =$FOSWIKI_PACKAGES= or =$PLUGINS_URL=).

---+++ Calculating DEPENDENCIES
When your module (the _depender_) depends on another module (a _dependee_), it is important to think carefully about what version of the dependee your module requires.

When you are working with Foswiki modules (such as contribs and plugins) you should list the version number of the module that you tested with. Normally you will want to use a <code>&gt;</code> condition, so that more recent versions will also work. If a dependency on a Foswiki module fails (because the module isn't installed, for example) then the installer script will pull *the latest version* of the module from Foswiki.org, whether that is the required version or not. This is a limitation of the way plugins are stored on Foswiki.org.

As an alternative to using the Version number, you can also compare to the SVN release number.  Write the version string as =>=r1234=.  Note that the Version number is the preferred method, and is reported to the user during the install.

When you are working with CPAN modules, you need to take account of the fact that there are *two types* of CPAN modules; _built-ins_ and _add-ons_.

*Built-ins* are perl modules that are pre-installed in the perl distribution. Since these modules are usually very stable, it is generally safe to express the version dependency as ">0" (i.e. "any version of the module will do").

Note however that the list of built-in modules is constantly growing with each new release of perl. So your module may be installed with a perl version that doesn't have the required module pre-installed. In this case, CPAN will *automatically try to upgrade the perl version*! There is no way around this, other than for the admin on the target system to *manually* install the module (download frm CPAN and build locally). You can help out the admin by expressing the dependency clearly, thus:

<code>
File::Find,>0,cpan,This module is shipped as part of standard perl from perl 5.8.0 onwards. If your perl installation is older than this, you should either upgrade perl, or *manually* install this module. If you allow this installer to continue, it will *automatically upgrade your perl installation* which is probably not what you want!
</code>

---+++ ONLYIF
A dependency may optionally be preceded by a condition that limits the cases
where the dependency applies. The condition is specified using a line that
contains <code>ONLYIF ( _condition_ )</code>, where _condition_ is a Perl
conditional. This is most useful for enabling dependencies only for certain
versions of other modules. For example,

<verbatim>
File::Munge,>0,cpan,...
ONLYIF ( $Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION < 1.025)
MyPackage::FixOldFileFind, >=1.000, perl, Optional, only required if we have an old version of Foswiki API.
</verbatim>

The =ONLYIF= only applies to the next dependency in the file.

---++ Writing a build script
The easiest way to write a new build script is to use the
=create_new_extension.pl= script, which is part of the !BuildContrib.
   1 Create your plugin source tree
      * =perl create_new_extension.pl !BathPlugin=
      * if you are working in a Subversion checkout, move the directory just created up one level to be at the same level as =core=.
   1 Edit =lib/Foswiki/Plugins/BathPlugin.pm= as required to create your
     plugin functionality
   1 Edit =lib/Foswiki/Plugins/BathPlugin/MANIFEST= and make sure it lists
     all the files you want to include in the release package
During development we recommend you use the =pseudo-install.pl= script to
soft-link your development code into your dev install. This script uses the
MANIFEST you write and creates softlinks (copies, on Windows) in your dev install that allow
you to run your test code without having to do a full re-install each time you
make a change.

If you have a pre-existing extension, and you want to package it for use with
!BuildContrib, then you (may) need to create the module directory and write the
=build.pl=, =MANIFEST= and =DEPENDENCIES= files. The easiest way to do this
is to copy those files from an existing extension in git, and modify
them for your use.

#InstallScripts
---++ Preparing the Installer
The installer script generated by the builder when target =release= is used is based on a template. This template is populated with lists of files and dependencies needed to make the extension-specific installer script.

---+++ PRE and POST processing scripts

You can extend this script by providing =PREINSTALL=, =POSTINSTALL=,
=PREUNINSTALL=, and/or =POSTUNINSTALL= files in the module directory.
These optional files are embedded into the template install script
at the appropriate stage of the installation. Read
=lib/Foswiki/Contrib/BuildContrib/TEMPLATE_installer.pl= (in the !BuildContrib)
to see how they fit in.

With the Foswiki 1.1 version of the install tools, these exits run as methods
of the =Configure::Package= object instance for the extension, and have access
to the package manifest and other information.  See the
[[System.PerlDoc?module=Foswiki::Configure::Package][PerlDoc for Foswiki::Configurer::Package]] for details (link requires BuildContrib to be installed).

If the script needs to report to the installer, it should return the message
as a simple string ending with a newline.  It will be presented as a verbatim block to the web
install, or as inline text for the shell installation.

<div class="foswikiHelp">
%X% Caution:  The pre/post scripts should not assume the standard installation
directories or topics when used to remove or otherwise manipulate files in the
installation.   You can use the Utility function =mapTarget= to find the
correct file location for the current install.  See

</div>

Also, as the file to be removed is most likely not listed in the manifest,
it will not be backed up during the install.  So use caution removing files
that would be required if fallback to the prior version of the plugin is
necessary.

For example, the POSTINSTALL script might look for an obsolete file from
a previous install, map it to the correct location for this installation, and
delete it if it exists.

<verbatim class="perl">
    my $this = shift;   # Get the object instance passed to the routine
    if ($this) {        # Verify that you are running in the new environment
        # Map the standard location to the absolute location on this
        # installation of Foswiki.   mapTarget is only available in Foswiki >= 1.1
        my $mapped = Foswiki::Configure::Util::mapTarget( $this->{_rootdir}, 'tools/obsolete.pl');
        my $count = unlink $mapped if ( -e $mapped ); # If it exists, delete it.
        return "Removed $mapped \n " if ($count);
        }
</verbatim>

#UnitTesting
---++ Testing
You are stongly recommended to develop a unit test suite for your extension.
Unit tests are kept in the =test/unit/&lt;name>= directory for each extension.

To run the unit tests you will need to set up the test environment as described
in Foswiki::Development.GettingStarted

The easiest way to generate tests for your extension is to copy the approach taken in another extension. See for example !ActionTrackerPlugin and !CommentPlugin, which both have extensive test suites.

Tests are run using
   * =perl build.pl test=

---++ Building a release
When you are almost ready to release, you should
   1 Build a release package and installer
      * =cd !BathPlugin/lib/Foswiki/Plugins/BathPlugin=
      * =perl build.pl release=
   1 Remove the softlinked version from your dev install
      * =cd= _dev install_
      * =perl pseudo-install.pl -uninstall !BathPlugin=
   1 Install the release package you just built:
      * =cd= _dev install_
      * =perl !BathPlugin/BathPlugin_installer=
   1 Test.

---+++ Token expansion
The =release= target automatically expands certain tokens in =.txt= files
and in the installer script. The following tokens are supported:
   * =%$<nop>MANIFEST%= - table of files in MANIFEST
   * =%$<nop>FILES%= - hash keyed on file name mapping to permissions i.e. 'data/System/ThsiTopic.txt' => 0664, 'lib/Foswiki/Plugins/BlahPlugin.pm' => 0775
   * =%$<nop>FOSWIKIAUTHORS%= - contents of =core/AUTHORS=
   * =%$<nop>DEPENDENCIES%= - list of dependencies from DEPENDENCIES
   * =%$<nop>VERSION%= standard perl version string
   * =%$<nop>RELEASE%= value of the =$RELEASE= perl global variable from your master perl module
   * =%$<nop>DATE%= - local date
   * =%$<nop>POD%= - POD documentation for the package, excluding test modules.
   * =%$<nop>PREINSTALL%= - contents of PREINSTALL
   * =%$<nop>POSTINSTALL%= - contents of POSTINSTALL
   * =%$<nop>PREUNINSTALL%= - contents of PREUNINSTALL
   * =%$<nop>POSTUNINSTALL%= - contents of POSTINSTALL
   * =%$<nop>BUGSURL%= - URL of bugs web
   * =%$<nop>INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%= - basic instructions for installing
*Note* =configure= uses the =| Version: |= row in the table in the extension topic to determine what version of the package is installed. In the sources this is normally set to =| Version: | %$VERSION% |=. When you =perl build.pl release=, %$VERSION% is extracted from the primary Plugin or Contrib module, so it's very reliable and low maintenance. You don't _have_ to use %$VERSION% in the =| Version: |= row of the extension topic - you can use your own version string if you want, or you can use %$RELEASE% which will take whatever value you have assigned to the $RELEASE variable in the extension master perl module. =configure= supports all of  manually generated triples (1.2.3), ISO dates, and =dd Mmmm yyy= format dates as valid RELEASE identifiers.

---++ Upload
When you are happy the release package is built correctly, you can
upload it.
   * =cd !BathPlugin/lib/Foswiki/Plugins/BathPlugin=
   * =perl build.pl upload=
By default the =upload= target will upload to Foswiki.org. You will be prompted
to enter an alternate upload target, should you require it (e.g. to upload to
private corporate repository). The upload updates the topic and any associated
Var topics published by the extension, and uploads zip, tgz, md5 and installer
files.

Defaults for the upload, passwords, etc. are stored in the =.buildcontrib=
file in the users home directory.

---++ Install support
Installer scripts build by !BuildContrib are important for the full
functioning of the extensions installer in =configure=.

The installer script shipped with the package is very simple. By default all
it does is to check the dependencies you list, and if necessary download and
install any missing Foswiki and CPAN modules. Other dependencies are simply
checked. Topics shipped with the
module are automatically merged into any existing local copies, ensuring
histories are preserved.

If you want your installer to do anything else then you will need to write a [[#InstallScripts][POSTINSTALL script]].

---++ Installation Instructions
You are strongly recommended to use this Contrib to help split your code development away from your live Foswiki environment, as described [[#DevelopmentModel][above]].
