---+!! <nop>ImageGalleryPlugin
%TOC%

---++ Description
This plugin helps you in viewing pictures that are attached to a topic in a nice thumbnail 
gallery. Clicking on a thumbnail zooms the image. You might navigate within your images using
a navigation toolbar to visit the next, previous, first or last image in your gallery.
Images and thumbnails are resized according to the given settings and are cached thereafter.
The order of images can be customized by putting a sequence number into the attachment comment.
An image attachment can be managed by clicking on the red dot in its title.
The plugin will generate the document relations "parent", "first", "last", "next", "previous"
for each image to improve navigation (only a few browsers support this, e.g. mozilla).
The image gallery is highly customizable using cascading stylesheets and html formats (see
below).

---++ Example
%IMAGEGALLERY{size="large" exclude="logo"}%
<span class="foswikiAlert">%NRIMAGES{exclude="logo"}%</span> images found.


---++ Syntax
---+++ Arguments
This plugin introduces two tags:
   * %<nop>IMAGEGALLERY{...}%: render an image gallery
   * %<nop>NRIMAGES%: returns the number of images attachted to a (list of) topics
that both take the following arguments:

| *Argument* | *Description* |
| topic | comma separated list of topics whose attachments should be displayed %BR% \
          (default: the current topic) |
| limit | maximum number of images to display (default: 0, meaning no limit). |
| include | regular expression an image must match to be part of the gallery |
| exclude | regular expression an image must _not_ match to be part of the gallery |
| frontend | select gallery interface, possible values are =lightbox= and =default=; \
             (defaults to =lightbox= if Foswiki:Extensions/JQueryPlugin is installed and =default= otherwise) |
| field | specify which property of the image has to match using =include= or =exclude=; \
          possible values: name, comment (default: name) |
| size | the thumbnail size, the actual geometries of a size can be configured below; \
         possible values: tiny, small, medium, large, huge  \
         (default: medium) |
| columns | number of thumbnails to be displayed in one row of the gallery %BR% \
            (default: 4) |
| docrels | flag to disable/enable document relations between images; \
         possible values are on, off, 0, 1 (default: on) |
| maxwidth | maximal display width of an image; images are scaled not to exceed this limit \
          while preserving aspect ratio %BR% \
          (default: 640) |
| maxheight | maximal display height of an image %BR% (default: 480) |
| minwidth | minimal display width of an image; images are scaled not to fall below this \
            limit while preserving aspect ratio %BR% (default: 0) |
| minheight | minimal display height of an image %BR% (default: 0) |
| header | header part of the gallery; only used if there is a =format= |
| format | html format of an image %BR% \
          (default: &lt;a href="$origurl"&gt;&lt;img src="$imageurl" title="$comment" width="$width" height="$height"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) |
| footer | footer part of the gallery; only used if there is a =format= |
| titles | toggles image and thumnail titles on and off %BR% \
          (default: off) |
| title | html format of an image title; "off" will hide the image's title %BR% \
          (default: $comment ($imgnr/$nrimgs)) |
| thumbtitle  | html format of a thumbnail title; "off" will hide the thumbnail's title %BR% \
          (default: $comment) |
| sort | set the initial order of the images, can be name, date, size or comment (default:date) |
| reverse | invert the initial order of the images, can be on or off (default:off) |

Note, that only =topic= is meaningful to %<nop>NRIMAGES%.

---+++ Variables
The parameters "format", "title" and "thumbtitle" can use the following variables to
refer to image properties:

| *Variable* | *Description* |
| $web | the web the image is located |
| $topic | the topic the image is located |
| $nrimages | the total number of images in the gallery |
| $n | a linefeed |
| $width | the display width of the image |
| $height | the display height of the image |
| $thumbwidth | the thumbnail width of the image |
| $thumbheight | the thumbnail height of the image |
| $origwidth | the original width of the image |
| $origheight | the original height of the image |
| $size | the size of the image |
| $sizeK | the size of the image in kilobytes |
| $comment | the comment of the image (with its sequence number stripped off) |
| $imgnr | the sequence number of the image |
| $date | the date when the image has been uploaded |
| $version | the version of the image attachment | 
| $name | the filename of the image |
| $wikiusername | the wikiusername who uploaded the image |
| $username | the username who uploaded the image |
| $imageurl | the url path of the display image |
| $thumburl | the url path of the thumbnail image |
| $origurl | the url path pointing to the original image attachment |

---+++ Query Parameters
The IGP will check for certain query parameters in the url. These are:
   * id=&lt;n;&gt;: distinguish multiple IMAGEGALLERYs in the same topic
   * filename=&lt;name&gt;: display the given file of the image set
   * refresh=on: recompute all images and thumbnails in the IGP cache
Each IMAGEGALLERY has an anchor, namely a &lt;a name="igp&lt;n&gt;"/&gt;, that
is used to scroll the display appropriately.

---++ Customization
First of all this plugin should come with reasonable default values, so that
you will get a nice image gallery (with regards to my taste) right on.
There are several things that are customizable:
   * customize a gallery using a compination of the arguments described above
   * add custom cascading styles in a topic to format the gallery
   * alter the default cascading styles in the [[%ATTACHURL%/style.css][style.css]]
     file attached to this topic
   * customize the plugin settings below

---+++ Cascading Stylesheets
The plugin emits the following css classes (see the comments in the [[%ATTACHURL%/style.css][style.css]] file):

<noautolink>
| *Class* | *Description* |
| igp | division for the complete output of the image gallery |
| igpThumbNails | division of all thumbnails |
| igpThumbNailsTable | table of thumbnail images |
| igpThumbNail | table cell of one thumbnail image |
| igpThumbNailTitle | table cell of the thumbnail title |
| igpPictureTable | table of the display image and the navigation bar |
| igpPicture | table cell of the display image |
| igpPictureTitle | division of the title of the display image |
| igpNavigation | table cell of the navigation bar |
| igpRedDot | span surrounding the red dot |
| igpAlert | span surrounding error messages |
</noautolink>

---+++ Adjusting the image sequence
By default the image gallery will display images in the order that they where uploaded.
This determines their _natural_ order. When you want to change this order you can
prefix the comment of the attachment with a sequence number. For example: given a
picture whose comment is "My old bike" that should be put at position 12
in your image gallery then change the comment to "12 <nop>- My old bike". This
will put the image at the desired position. Sequence numbers don't necessarily need
to be unique, that is if there's another picture with a comment like 
"12 <nop>- My new bike" then the natural order of the both is relevant. In general,
a picture will be put at position =&lt;nr&gt;= if its attachment comment has the format
<verbatim>
  <nr><space>-<space><comment>
</verbatim>
Note, that the $comment variable will only display =&lt;comment&gt;= , that is with 
=&lt;nr&gt;&lt;space&gt;-&lt;space&gt;= stripped off.
